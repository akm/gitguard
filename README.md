# gitguard

## Concept

`gitguard` supports to avoid mix of code written by human and code generated by program.

## Installation

To install cli, simply run:
```
go get github.com/akm/gitguard
```

Make sure your PATH includes the $GOPATH/bin directory so your commands can be easily used:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```


## Usage

Run your command after `gitguard`.

If the workspace is clean, your command will be run.
If not, your command won't be run and show messages like this:

```
$ gitguard foo bar baz
[gitguard] There are files that need to be committed first.
[gitguard] git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   gitguard.go
```
